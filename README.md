#OverVeiw Project

Colorado Board of Election Committy has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election using a set of program tools such as Python, Visual Studio Code, and GitBash

#Summery

Using Python and reading in the CSV election data set we determined out of the 369,711 votes some patterns and analysis.
We created a python script and would read and write data, to perform calculations on the count of ballots to report our analysis.

There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
  The three candidates were:
    Charles Casper Stockham
    Diana DeGette
    Raymon Anthony Doane
  With the candidate results being:
  
  Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  
  Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  
  Candidate 3 received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.

#Challenge Overveiw

Hardest thing i learned and found the most fun of this, was learning to read and modify scrips and coding to work from a CVS file of data to a programming 
script that takes that data and summerises the whole lot and makes it ledgable for simple eyes to read
